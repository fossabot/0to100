### Run pre-commit hooks manually

All pre-commit hooks will be run automatically when pushing changes.
They can also be run on staged files or on all files manually:

```bash
# Run all hooks against currently staged files,
# this is what pre-commit runs by default when committing:
pre-commit run

# Run all the hooks against all the files:
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific hook against all staged files:
pre-commit run black
pre-commit run flake8
pre-commit run isort
pre-commit run pylint
```
